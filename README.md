# MinesweeperSharp
MinesweeperSharp is a simple Minesweeper game made using C# and Windows Forms.

## How to Play
This game plays just like any other Minesweeper game. If you already know how to play other versions of Minesweeper, then you won't really need to read this section.
* There are bombs hidden within the grid. Left-clicking on a tile will either give a number, a large empty area with numbers on the edges, or a bomb, and right-clicking will put a flag on that tile.
* The numbers on certain squares indicate the number of mines adjacent to that tile.
* This version of Minesweeper has a 15x15 grid, with a total of 30 bombs. A common strategy is to randomly click until you get a big opening with lots of numbers.
* Flags are used to prevent a mine from exploding on the corresponding tile.
* When you click on a mine, it's game over and you have to restart from the very beginning.
